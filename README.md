# Run Buddy

## Description

This web-application was created to act as an interface for new clients when they visit the "Run Buddy" website. For context Run Buddy is an organization that trains runners to become the best versions of themselves.

This problem has been solved using HTML and CSS, and in this app I learned how to further implement different methods of containerization.
